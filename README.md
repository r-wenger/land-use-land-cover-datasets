- 2022.[MultiSenGE](https://zenodo.org/record/6375466) 
MultiSenGE is a new large-scale multimodal and multitemporal benchmark dataset covering one of the biggest administrative region located in the Eastern part of France. It contains 8,157 patches of 256 * 256 pixels for Sentinel-2 L2A, Sentinel-1 GRD and a regional LULC topographic regional database.

- 2020.[CaneSat](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/canesat)
This dataset contains multispectral high resolution 1627 image patches of size 10 x 10 pixels with each pixel size of 10mx10m. These patches are generated from the Sentinel-2 (A/B) satellite images acquired during the period of October 2018 to May 2019. It covered one life cycle (12 months) of the sugarcane crop in the region of the Karnataka, India.

- 2019.[BigEarthNet](https://bigearth.net/)
BigEarthNet is a benchmark archive, consisting of 590,326 pairs of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 image patches. The first version (v1.0-beta) of BigEarthNet includes only Sentinel 2 images. Recently, it has been enriched by Sentinel-1 images to create a multi-modal BigEarthNet benchmark archive (called also as BigEarthNet-MM).

- 2019.[BigEarthNet](https://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/IV-2-W7/153/2019/)
The SEN12MS dataset contains 180,662 patch triplets of corresponding Sentinel-1 dual-pol SAR data, Sentinel-2 multi-spectral images, and MODIS-derived land cover maps. The patches are distributed across the land masses of the Earth and spread over all four meteorological seasons. This is reflected by the dataset structure.
